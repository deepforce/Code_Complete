# 1. Welcome to Software Construction

#### 1.1 What Is Software Construction

Software development activities:

* Problem definition
* Requirement development
* Construction planning
* Software architecture, or high-level design
* Detailed design
* Coding and debugging
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* Integration
* System testing
* Corrective maintenance

**Construction** is mostly coding and debugging but also involves **detailed design construction planning, unit testing, integration, integration testing, and other activities**.

Some of the specific tasks involved in construction:

* Verifying that the groundwork has been laid so that construction can proceed successfully
* Determining how your code will be tested
* Designing and writing classes and routines
* Creating and naming variables and named constants
* Selecting control structures and organizing blocks of statements
* Unit testing, integration testing, and debugging your own code
* Reviewing other team members' low-level designs and code and having them review yours
* Polishing code by carefully formatting and commenting it
* Integrating software components that were created separately
* Tuning code to make it faster and use fewer resources

Important **nonconstruction activities** include **management, requirements development, software architecture, user-interface design, system testing, and maintenance**.
